# Redux Toolkit Guide

## Configuring the Store

The store configuration is typically done under `/src/App`, though this is not a mandatory locationâ€”just a commonly followed convention.

```javascript
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    // Reducers go here
  },
});

export default store;
```

### Explanation:
`configureStore` is the standard method for creating a Redux store. Internally, it uses the low-level `createStore` method, but provides good defaults for a better development experience. 

The `reducer` key is essential as it defines the structure of your application's state by specifying the reducers that manage different parts of the state.

## Slices

A slice combines **state**, **actions**, and **reducers** into a single unit, simplifying the management of Redux logic.

### Slice Definition

A slice is created using the `createSlice` API. It accepts:
1. An initial state.
2. An object of reducer functions.
3. A "slice name."

`createSlice` automatically generates action creators and action types corresponding to the reducers and state. Internally, it uses `createAction` and `createReducer`, allowing you to write "mutating" immutable updates using Immer.

Example:

```javascript
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const initialState = {
  theme: "dark",
};

export const brightnessSlice = createSlice({
  name: "theme",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    changeTheme: (state) => {
      state.theme = state.theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark";
    },
  },
});

export const { changeTheme } = brightnessSlice.actions;
export default brightnessSlice.reducer;
```

### Key Components:
- **`changeTheme`**: An action creator used to dispatch actions for updating the slice's state.
- **`brightnessSlice.reducer`**: A reducer function that updates the slice's state based on dispatched actions.

### Integrating the Slice into the Store

To use the slice, integrate its reducer into the Redux store:

```javascript
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import ThemeChangerReducer from "../features/brightness/brightnessSlice";

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    theme: ThemeChangerReducer,
  },
});

export default store;
```

---

## Using the Reducer in a Component

The reducer and actions can now be used in components. Example:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { changeTheme } from "../features/brightness/brightnessSlice";

function Navbar() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const theme = useSelector((state) => state.theme.theme);

  const dynamicStyle = {
    color: theme === "light" ? "black" : "white",
    backgroundColor: theme === "light" ? "white" : "black",
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Box>
        <AppBar position="static" style={dynamicStyle}>
          <Toolbar>
            <IconButton
              size="large"
              edge="start"
              aria-label="menu"
              sx={{ mr: 2 }}
            >
              <MenuIcon style={dynamicStyle} />
            </IconButton>
            <Typography variant="h6" component="div" sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
              Base64 Encode-Decode
            </Typography>
            <Box className="space-x-4">
              <Button onClick={handleEncode} variant="text" style={dynamicStyle}>
                Encode
              </Button>
              <Button onClick={handleDecode} variant="text" style={dynamicStyle}>
                Decode
              </Button>
              <Button onClick={infoPage} variant="text" style={dynamicStyle}>
                What is Base64
              </Button>
              <Button
                startIcon={theme === "light" ? <LightModeIcon /> : <DarkModeIcon />}
                onClick={() => dispatch(changeTheme())}
                style={dynamicStyle}
              />
            </Box>
          </Toolbar>
        </AppBar>
      </Box>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Selectors
Selectors are functions that extract and return specific pieces of state from the Redux store.

### 2. Dispatch
Dispatch is a function provided by the Redux store to send or "dispatch" actions. Dispatching an action triggers the corresponding reducer to update the state.
