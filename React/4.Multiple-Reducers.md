# Understanding `combineReducers` in Redux

In Redux, we use the `combineReducers` function to merge multiple reducers into a single **root reducer**. This is necessary because the `createStore` function in Redux accepts only a single reducer.

---

## Initial State

Suppose we start with the following initial state:

```javascript
const initialState = {
  product: productList,
  cardItem: [],
  wishList: [],
};
```

Here:
- `product` represents the list of products.
- `cardItem` is an empty array for cart items.
- `wishList` is an empty array for the wishlist.

---

## `combineReducers` Function

The `combineReducers` function takes an object where **keys** represent the state slice names, and the **values** are the corresponding reducer functions.

### Example

```javascript
import { combineReducers } from "redux";

const reducer = combineReducers({
  product: productListReducer,
  cardItem: cardItemReducer,
  wishList: wishListReducer,
});
```

- Here, `product`, `cardItem`, and `wishList` are keys for different state slices.
- The corresponding reducers (`productListReducer`, `cardItemReducer`, and `wishListReducer`) manage their respective state slices.

This will result in a **root reducer** that Redux can pass to `createStore`.

---

## Key-Reducer Mapping

You can change the **keys** in the `combineReducers` function. For example:

```javascript
const reducer = combineReducers({
  a: productListReducer,
  b: cardItemReducer,
  c: wishListReducer,
});
```

In this case:
- The state slice names will change to `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- While it still works perfectly, it **reduces clarity** because the keys (`a`, `b`, `c`) are no longer meaningful.

**Recommendation:** Use meaningful keys that describe the state slices.

---

## Updated Reducer Example

Here's an updated example of the `cardItemReducer`:

```javascript
export const cardReducers = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case CART_ADD_ITEM:
      return [...state, action.payload];
      
    case CART_REMOVE_ITEM:
      return state.filter(
        (cardItem) => cardItem.productId !== action.payload.productId
      );

    case CART_INCREASE_ITEM:
      return state.map((cardItem) => {
        if (cardItem.productId === action.payload.productId) {
          return {
            ...cardItem,
            quantity: cardItem.quantity + action.payload.increment,
          };
        }
        return cardItem; // Return the original item if no changes
      });

    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

---

## Explanation of Changes

- **Single Reducer per State Slice:** Instead of managing all states in one reducer, we now handle each state slice (`product`, `cardItem`, `wishList`) in a separate reducer.
- **State Initialization:** Each reducer receives its own slice of the state as the initial value (e.g., `state = []` for `cardReducers`).
- **State Updates:** We use:
  - `filter` for removing items.
  - `map` for modifying items.
  - `spread operator (...)` to retain existing state and update only necessary fields.
