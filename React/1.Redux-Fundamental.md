Here is your corrected and grammatically improved markdown:

---

## What is Prop Drilling?

Prop drilling refers to the process of passing data from a parent component to a deeply nested child component through multiple layers of intermediate components. This can become cumbersome and hard to maintain, especially when the data needs to be passed through many levels.

---

## What is State Mutation?

State mutation refers to directly modifying the state of a component. In React, mutating state can lead to unexpected behavior, as React does not re-render the component when the state is mutated directly.

Example of state mutation:
```js
const [state, setState] = useState({ count: 0 });
state.count = state.count + 1; // Mutation
setState(state); // Does not trigger a re-render
```
In the above example, React will not re-render the component when the state is mutated directly, even though the state value is updated. This is because React compares the old state and the new state by reference, and since the reference did not change, it assumes the state is the same.

---

## What is a Plain JavaScript Object?

A plain JavaScript object is a basic object created using curly braces `{}` or the `Object` constructor. It is a simple key-value pair data structure and does not have any special methods or behaviors attached to it, like other complex objects (such as arrays, functions, etc.).

---

## Functional Programming in React

In React, functional programming involves using pure functions to handle state and render logic. The idea is to avoid side effects and mutating state, focusing on declarative code.

---

## React State Updates (Non-Mutating Example)

If you use this:
```js
const [state, setState] = useState({ count: 0 });
state.count = state.count + 1; // Mutation
setState(state); // Does not trigger re-render
```
It will not render the updated value. If you log the state, you'll see the incremented value in the console:
```js
console.log(state);
```
This happens because React does not detect a change in the state when it's mutated directly.

Now, if you use:
```js
setState({ count: state.count + 1 }); // Non-mutating way
```
In this way, a new object is passed to React, and it compares the new object with the old one. Since they are different, React will re-render the component.

---

## Passing Additional Variables in State

If you pass another variable in the state:
```js
const [state, setState] = useState({ count: 0, counterName: 'Timer' });

<p>{state.counterName}</p>
```
It shows the counter name and the current count. However, when you update the count like this:
```js
setState({ count: state.count + 1 });
```
Only the count is updated, and the `counterName` is lost because the new state object only includes the `count` property. To preserve the `counterName`, you can pass the previous state:
```js
setState({ ...state, count: state.count + 1 });
```

Now both the count and `counterName` will be displayed when the button is clicked.

A better way to write the above code:
```js
setState((prevState) => ({
  ...prevState,
  count: prevState.count + 1,
}));
```

---

## Redux Reducer

Reducers are state updaters in Redux. A reducer is a pure function that receives the current state and an action, then returns a new state.

Example of a simple reducer:
```js
function stateUpdate(state) {
  return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
}
```

You cannot use `setState` inside a reducer. Instead, Redux expects the reducer to return a new state based on the current state.

```js
function stateUpdate(state) {
  return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
}
```

Now you can update the state:
```js
let reduxState = { count: 0, name: 'furious5', age: 21 };

reduxState = stateUpdate(reduxState);
console.log(reduxState);
```

---

## Action Types in Redux

In Redux, an action is a plain JavaScript object that describes a change that should happen to the state. It must have a `type` property, and optionally a `payload` property.

```js
function reducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === 'post/increment') {
    return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
  } else if (action.type === 'post/decrement') {
    return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
  }
  return state;
}

let reduxState = { count: 0 };

reduxState = reducer(reduxState, { type: 'post/increment' });
reduxState = reducer(reduxState, { type: 'post/decrement' });
```

---

## Handling Undefined Actions in Redux

To avoid returning `undefined` when an action type is not found, we add a default `return state` at the end of the reducer.

```js
function reducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === 'post/increment') {
    return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
  } else if (action.type === 'post/decrement') {
    return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
  }
  return state; // Default case to return the state unchanged
}
```

---

## Redux with Payload

When an action has a payload, it can be used to modify the state based on dynamic values passed in the action.

```js
function reducer(state, action) {
  if (action.type === 'post/increment') {
    return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
  } else if (action.type === 'post/decrement') {
    return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
  } else if (action.type === 'post/increment-by') {
    return { ...state, count: state.count + action.payload };
  }
  return state;
}

reduxState = reducer(reduxState, { type: 'post/increment' });
reduxState = reducer(reduxState, { type: 'post/decrement' });
reduxState = reducer(reduxState, { type: 'post/increment-by', payload: 2 });
console.log(reduxState);
```

---

## Moving to Redux

In Redux, `createStore` is used to create a Redux store. The store holds the state of your application.

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux';

let store = createStore(reducer);
console.log(store);
```

You can use `store.getState()` to get the current state.

To initialize the state:
```js
let reduxState = { count: 0, name: 'furious5', age: 21 };

function reducer(state = reduxState, action) {
  if (action.type === 'post/increment') {
    return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
  } else if (action.type === 'post/decrement') {
    return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
  }
  return state;
}
```

---

## Dispatching Actions

The `dispatch` function is used to send actions to the store.

```js
store.dispatch({ type: 'post/increment' });
console.log(store.getState());
```

---

## Subscribe to State Changes

You can use `store.subscribe()` to automatically log the state when it changes:

```js
store.subscribe(() => {
  console.log(store.getState());
});

store.dispatch({ type: 'post/increment' });
store.dispatch({ type: 'post/increment' });
```
