In Razor pages, the `@` symbol is a key part of the syntax used to transition between HTML and C# code. Here’s a detailed explanation of how and when to use the `@` symbol in Razor pages:

### 1. **Inline C# Code**
   - **Embedding C# Expressions**: The `@` symbol is used to insert C# expressions directly into HTML.
     ```razor
     <p>Hello, @Model.Name!</p>
     ```
     - In this example, `@Model.Name` will be replaced with the value of the `Name` property from the `Model` object.

### 2. **Code Blocks**
   - **Defining Code Blocks**: You can use `@` to start a code block where you can write multiple lines of C# code.
     ```razor
     @code {
         var message = "Welcome to Razor Pages!";
         <p>@message</p>
     }
     ```
     - Here, a code block is defined with `@code {}`. Inside the block, you can declare variables, call methods, and include other C# logic.

### 3. **Control Structures**
   - **Loops, Conditionals, etc.**: `@` is used to introduce C# control structures like loops and conditionals.
     ```razor
     @if (Model.IsLoggedIn)
     {
         <p>Welcome back, @Model.UserName!</p>
     }
     else
     {
         <p>Please log in.</p>
     }
     ```
     - This snippet uses an `@if` statement to conditionally render different content based on the value of `Model.IsLoggedIn`.

### 4. **Calling C# Methods**
   - **Calling Methods**: You can use `@` to call C# methods and display their return values.
     ```razor
     <p>The time is @DateTime.Now.ToString("HH:mm:ss")</p>
     ```
     - This example calls the `DateTime.Now.ToString()` method to display the current time.

### 5. **Rendering Partial Views or Components**
   - **Rendering Other Pages/Components**: The `@` symbol is also used to render partial views or components.
     ```razor
     @await Html.PartialAsync("_LoginPartial")
     ```
     - Here, `@await Html.PartialAsync("_LoginPartial")` is used to render a partial view named `_LoginPartial`.

### 6. **Directive Keywords**
   - **Razor Directives**: Many Razor-specific directives start with `@`, such as `@page`, `@model`, `@inject`, `@functions`, and others.
     ```razor
     @page "/index"
     @model IndexModel
     ```
     - `@page` specifies the routing for the page, and `@model` specifies the model the page is bound to.
Every coding language needs a way to add comments. In Razor, you use the following syntax to create a 
comment:
@* This is my comment. *@

 This is useful for when you want to add a 
comment to your code but do not want it to appear in the markup sent to the client.

You can still use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS comments in your views, but keep in mind that HTML 
comments are sent to the client and can be read if someone views the source of your page. Here’s an 
example:
Chapter 3 ■ MVC Razor Syntax and HTML Helpers
75
<!-- this is an HTML comment. It will be sent to the client browser but is hidden on the page -->
<script>
 // this is a JavaScript comment
</script>

<style>
 /* This is a CSS Comment*/
</style>
You can also use C# comments inside code blocks. The C# comments do not get sent to the client.
@{
 // this is a comment inside of a code block
 /*
 * This is a multi-line comment inside a code block
 */
}

}

Explicit Markup

Sometimes you might want to have plain text mixed in with your code. Without the presence of angle 
brackets, Razor has a difficult time finding the end of your code block. To get around this problem, the Razor 
team invented the @: operator and the <text> block. The @: operator is used for single-line explicit markup. 
<text> is used for multiple lines of markup. L

@if (12 == 12)
{
 @: I have @Model.Strings.Count in my guitar case
}
<text>
 Only the best guitar players play @Model.Brand
 and we know who we are.
</text>

### 7. **Escaping @ in Razor**
   - **Literal `@` Symbol**: If you need to display a literal `@` symbol in the output, you can escape it by using `@@`.
     ```razor
     <p>Email us at support@@example.com</p>
     ```
     - This will render as `support@example.com`.

### 8. **Raw HTML Rendering**
   - **Raw HTML**: You can use `@Html.Raw()` to render raw HTML content that should not be encoded.
     ```razor
     @Html.Raw("<strong>Important:</strong> This is raw HTML.")
     ```
     - This will render the `<strong>` tag correctly in the browser without being encoded.

### 9. **Injecting Dependencies**
   - **Dependency Injection**: You can inject services into your Razor page using the `@inject` directive.
     ```razor
     @inject IConfiguration Configuration
     ```
     - This injects an `IConfiguration` instance into the page, which can then be used in the code.
