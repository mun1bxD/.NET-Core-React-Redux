# Razor Comments and Explicit Markup

## Comments in Razor

Every coding language needs a way to add comments. In Razor, you can create comments using the following syntax:

```razor
@* This is my comment. *@
```

This is useful when you want to add comments to your code that **do not** appear in the markup sent to the client.

You can also still use **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS** comments in your views. However, remember that **HTML comments** are sent to the client and can be read if someone views the source of your page.

Hereâ€™s an example:

```html
<!-- This is an HTML comment. It will be sent to the client browser but is hidden on the page. -->
```

### JavaScript and CSS Comments

```javascript
<script>
  // This is a JavaScript comment
</script>
```

```css
<style>
  /* This is a CSS Comment */
</style>
```

### C# Comments in Razor Code Blocks

You can also use **C# comments** inside Razor code blocks, and these comments will **not** be sent to the client:

```razor
@{
  // This is a comment inside a code block
  /*
   * This is a multi-line comment inside a code block
   */
}
```

## Explicit Markup in Razor

Sometimes, you might want to include plain text mixed in with your code. Without angle brackets, Razor can struggle to find the end of your code block. To solve this, Razor offers the `@:` operator for single-line explicit markup and the `<text>` block for multiple lines of markup.

### Example: Single-line Explicit Markup

```razor
@if (12 == 12)
{
  @: I have @Model.Strings.Count in my guitar case
}
```

### Example: Multi-line Explicit Markup

```razor
<text>
  Only the best guitar players play @Model.Brand
  and we know who we are.
</text>
```
