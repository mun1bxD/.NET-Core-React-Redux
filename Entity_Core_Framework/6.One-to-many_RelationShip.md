# One-to-Many Relationship in Entity Framework Core

In this example, we demonstrate how to set up a one-to-many relationship between a `Teacher` and `NewStudent` in Entity Framework Core. Each teacher can have multiple students, but each student is assigned to only one teacher. We'll explore the table structure, C# models, and `DbContext` configuration.

## SQL Table Structure

### Table 1: Teacher
The `Teacher` table contains basic information about the teacher.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Teacher (
    TeacherID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    TeacherName VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### Table 2: NewStudent
The `NewStudent` table stores information about students and includes a foreign key to the `Teacher` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE NewStudent (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentName VARCHAR(50),
    TeacherID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (TeacherID) REFERENCES Teacher(TeacherID)
);
```

## C# Models

### Model 1: Teacher
The `Teacher` class represents the `Teacher` table. It has a navigation property that establishes the one-to-many relationship with `NewStudent`.

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

namespace FlowerShop.Models
{
    public class Teacher
    {
        [Key]
        public int TeacherID { get; set; }

        [Required]
        [MaxLength(50)]
        public string TeacherName { get; set; }

        // Navigation property for the one-to-many relationship
        public virtual ICollection<NewStudent> Students { get; set; }
    }
}
```

### Model 2: NewStudent
The `NewStudent` class represents the `NewStudent` table. It includes a foreign key `TeacherID` and a navigation property to reference the `Teacher` entity.

```csharp
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;

namespace FlowerShop.Models
{
    public class NewStudent
    {
        [Key]
        public int StudentID { get; set; }

        [Required]
        [MaxLength(50)]
        public string StudentName { get; set; }

        [ForeignKey("Teacher")]
        public int TeacherID { get; set; }

        // Navigation property
        public virtual Teacher Teacher { get; set; }
    }
}
```

## DbContext Configuration

### ApplicationDbContext
The `ApplicationDbContext` class inherits from `DbContext` and includes `DbSet` properties for `Teacher` and `NewStudent`. The `OnModelCreating` method defines the one-to-many relationship.

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using FlowerShop.Models;

namespace FlowerShop.Data
{
    public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
    {
        public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options)
            : base(options)
        {
        }

        public DbSet<Teacher> Teachers { get; set; }
        public DbSet<NewStudent> NewStudents { get; set; }

        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            // Configure the one-to-many relationship
            modelBuilder.Entity<Teacher>()
                .HasMany(t => t.Students)
                .WithOne(s => s.Teacher)
                .HasForeignKey(s => s.TeacherID);
        }
    }
}
```

In the `OnModelCreating` method:
- We specify that `Teacher` has many `Students`.
- We configure the navigation properties on both sides of the relationship.
- The foreign key `TeacherID` is set in the `NewStudent` table, referencing the `Teacher` entity.
